## Installation

I really have no idea what I am doing, I am surprised this application (seemingly) works as well as it does, so please excuse any mistakes or bugs and post an issue please if you'd like.

You can either grab the exe installer from the releases tab or clone the repo and run "npm run tauri (build/dev)" with the proper prerequisties from tauri v1. This application is built for and on windows, though I do plan on creating an android port next, with syncing between the two over the local network, linux support will come as well.

## License

You can do whatever you want with this, I made it speficially to help myself/people, view the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more details.
