### Note

I made this because Google Sheets is not for me. I was previously using a template made by Stevie, [here](https://youtu.be/2gIu00WcbTI?si=iOx1pcTTzlFZqkPm), for data/stat tracking. I really like it, minus a couple of features that were excessive for my use case, but this program largely aims to recreate a lot of the features I used in that document, like the projected calculations, differences, etc.

## Building & Installation

### Disclaimer: I really have no idea what I am doing.
I am surprised this application (seemingly) works as well as it does, so please excuse any mistakes, bugs, or performance issues and please post an issue if you'd like.

You can simply download the prebuilt binary for windows in the releases section. To build it yourself, you first need to install the dependenice for Tauri [here](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (I am using Tauri V1 in this project), and then run "npm run tauri build/dev" for the release and development version, respectivley.

## License

You can do whatever you want with this. I made it specifically to help myself/people. View the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more details.
