## Note

I made this because Google Sheets is not for me and I was previously using a Google Sheets template made by Stevie, [here](https://youtu.be/2gIu00WcbTI?si=iOx1pcTTzlFZqkPm), for tracking data. I really liked it, minus a couple of features that were excessive for my use case, but this program largely aims to recreate a lot of the features I used in that document, like the projected calculations and differences etc.

## Features

I will flesh this out later. Here are some supplementary screenshots:

This looks terrible, but I will fix it later. There is also a formatting bug on the notes page, but it doesn't break functionality.

## Installation

I really have no idea what I am doing. I am surprised this application (seemingly) works as well as it does, so please excuse any mistakes or bugs and post an issue if you'd like.

You can either grab the exe installer from the releases tab or clone the repo and run "npm run tauri (build/dev)" with the proper prerequisites from Tauri v1. This application is built for and on Windows, though I do plan on creating an Android port next, with syncing between the two over the local network. Linux support will come as well.

## License

You can do whatever you want with this. I made it specifically to help myself/people. View the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more details.
